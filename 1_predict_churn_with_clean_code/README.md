# Predict Customer Churn

Project Title:
**Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity
 
## Project Description
In this project, I am implementing the skills acquired in testing, logging, and best coding practices within the [Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821) offered by Udacity. 

The project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package can be run interactively from the command-line interface (CLI).

The dataset has been pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/code).

## Prerequisites
All dependecies can be found in the *requirements.txt* file. You can pip install all required libraries in your environment by running the following command in the CLI:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Running Files

All functions to load, transform and fit the given dataset are written in the *churn_library.py* script. 

You can also run directly this file, by simply run the following command:

```
python churn_library.py
```

Depending on your version of python, the cli command can vary (e.g., python3).

Testing and logging script is called *churn_script_logging_and_tests.py* and same command as above can be run:

```
python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
```
